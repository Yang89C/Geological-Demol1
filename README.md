# Geological-Demol1
The first attempt to establish a simulated geological geography internship, with weather and transmission systems, has built phenomena such as Giant's Road, volcanoes, rivers, fault mountains, waterfalls, lagoons, and marine erosion landforms. There are currently PC and Android versions available, but the VR version has not been developed yet. The interactive system of the system is not yet complete.
